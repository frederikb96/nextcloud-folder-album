## WIP diralbum branch

This is a throwaway or work-in-progress branch with code to convert Nextcloud folders to albums.

### USAGE

1. Create `todo-photo-folders.txt`. This is a list of paths in a Nextcloud instance you want converted to albums, one per line. `Photos/2020/Camping trip`, `Photos/2021/sunny day`, etc. Exclude the leading slash.
1. Edit `main.py` directly, in the section titled `YOUR CONFIG - change these`.
1. Run `./convert-all.sh`.

It expects that the folders listed contain media compatible with the Photos and Memories apps (generally just photos and videos). Sub-folders are ignored.
